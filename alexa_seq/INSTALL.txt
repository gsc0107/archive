#Overview: 
#Briefly, in order to run this pipeline. You will need to do the following
#1.) Unpack the code (already done if you are reading this)
#2.) Add some environment variables to your .bashrc file  (see below...)
#3.) Install some dependencies (bioinformatics tools used by the pipeline)
#4.) Create an updated configuration file specific to your system
#5.) Locate basic details of the data to be processed (i.e. path to directory containing sequence files) and the comparisons to be performed
#6.) Process the data by following the step-by-step instructions in the user manual

#Documentation (included with ALEXA-Seq downloads):
#Detailed descriptions of the pipeline and analysis itself are provided in the ALEXA-Seq User Manual
#Detailed instructions for installation of dependencies are provided in the ALEXA-Seq Linux Installation Guide

#Location of EnsEMBL API and BioPerl files.
#Each version of the ensembl API should be installed in the following directory in a sub-directory of the form: ensembl_56_perl_API  (for version 56 in this case)
#By default you will have downloaded several versions of the ensembl API as well as BioPerl with the source code.  These are stored in the 'ensembl_api' directory downloaded directory of code
