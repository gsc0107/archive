#This file contains project specific configuration parameters for a project to be analyzed with the ALEXA-Seq pipeline
#A file such as this one should be created for each project at the outset of the analysis
#A 'project' consists of all sequence libraries that are related to each other and which are to be compared to each other

#First update some project specific configuration values - Do not use spaces in these entries!

#PARAMETERS DEFINED FOR EACH PROJECT
#Abbreviated name for the project 
PROJECT_NAME=5FU

#Brief description of the project
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION=Comparison of 5-FU sensitive and resistant cell lines (demo data)

#The version of EnsEMBL to use
ENSEMBL_VERSION=53

#The species name for the analysis
SPECIES_NAME=Homo_sapiens
SPECIES_NAME_COMMON=Human

#The UCSC build that this version corresponds to
UCSC_BUILD=hg18

#The ALEXA-Seq build to use - This is the abbreviated name for the ALEXA-seq annotation data (corresponds to the species/build codes used by EnsEMBL)
ALEXA_SEQ_DB=hs_53_36o

#Alignment option.  1=BLAST only   2=BLAST+BWA  3=BWA (for this option your junction/boundary databases need to be tailored to your read length!)
ALIGNMENT_OPTION=3

#Regions file version to use (for parallel jobs these determine how many genes are processed in one block) - Options: 50 or 250
REGIONS_FILE_VERSION=250

#The minimum overlap required for reads hitting a junction/boundary (i.e. how many bases of the alignment cross the centre of the junction/boundary)
MIN_OVERLAP=6

#The length of junction/boundary sequence database to use (do not change this unless you downloaded or created a database with different lengths)
JUNCTION_SEQ_LENGTH=62
BOUNDARY_SEQ_LENGTH=62

#The website version to use (currently 'website' or 'website_medium')
#Switch to website_medium if number of libraries > 4 or group comparisons defined below
WEBSITE_VERSION=website

#Do not use spaces within any of the values each each record line below! (because space is being used as a record seperator here...)
#LANE entries - Each of the following lines corresponds to a single LANE of data
#DataPath is the complete path to the datafiles (e.g., _seq and _prb or _qseq or _sequence (fastq) files)
#SeqFileType can be 'seq', 'qseq' or 'fastq'. Data files may be uncompressed or compressed with gzip or bzip.
#ReadLength is the length of each read of the read pair
#ReadTrim is the number of bases you wish to trim from the particular lane (Triming odd numbered reads is a good idea - but otherwise leave at 0)
#MaxN is the maximum number of ambiguous bases (Ns) allowed for each read
#MinPhred is the minimum mean phred score allowed for each read. If set to 1, no filtering is applied, but distribution of scores is calculated. Set to 0 to skip even this.
#QualType is the phred score type used. Most current illumina data (>v1.3) should be of the type "illumina_phred". 

#Example of getting read length using this file:
#perl -ne 'if ($_ =~ /^LANE/){@data=split(" ", $_); print "bzcat $data[4]s_$data[3]_1_0001_qseq.txt.bz2 | head -n 1 | cut -f 9 | wc \n"}' ALEXA_Seq_LnCAP_AR_KnockIn.conf

#LIBRARY ENTRIES
#Each of the following lines corresponds to a single LIBRARY (each has 1 or more LANES of data associated with it by the Library ID)
#The group variable is used to define two groups within your list of libraries.  
#For example if you have several tumour/normal comparisons, make all the Tumours group '1' and all the normal group '2'

#RecordType LibraryId LibraryName Group
LIBRARY HS04391  MIP101 1
LIBRARY HS04401  MIP5FU 2

#COMPARISON ENTRIES
#Each ot the following lines corresponds to a COMPARISON between two LIBRARIES
#The order of the two libraries of a comparison matters (will affect the signs of differential/alternative expression values)
#The first listed should be the condition of interest or the 'later' condition
#For example:
# - if you have tumour vs. normal (put the tumour library first)
# - if you treated vs. untreated (put treated library first)
# - if you have drug resistant vs. drug responsive (put drug resistant first)
