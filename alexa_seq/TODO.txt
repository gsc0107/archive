#LIST OF IMPROVEMENTS, FEATURES TO ADD, ETC.

#FEATURES
- Viewer - Add project description, notes and examples directly to Summary page for each project
- Viewer - Search page - Make search page prettier (add stuff from template website to query template)
- Viewer - Search page - Add search button to webpage template
- Viewer - Summary page - Hide library stats links with plus/minus button
- Viewer - Summary page - Hide candidate gene/protein lins with plus/minus button?
- Viewer - Summary page - Move download package link to bottom of page?
- Viewer - Expression page - Add "expressed-matrix files for download"

#IMPROVEMENTS
- Clean-up - Add optional step script to clean up temp files no longer needed at the end of the analysis
- Automated pathway/GO analysis for DE and AE gene lists
- Automated clustering by feature expression to identify features that best distinguish the conditions
- Add method to capture totally de novo exons within EnsEMBL genes that are currently missed by EnsEMBL
- Improve calling of exon boundary extensions.  Currently, too many false positives from highly expressed genes, with comparatively low coverage of the extended boundary ...
  - To be expressed, coverage should be within the x% of gene for z% of the bases
- Incorporate usage of 'BigWig' and 'BigBED' UCSC files.
- Move complexity calculation step (currently 7D) to later step (after 10) to facilitate merging
- fix candidate gene/peptide pages to work with group AE results
- fix AE highlighting on gene pages to work with group AE results
- Implement SSL for webpage to make non-public projects an option
- Add new library stats/figures to break down percentage of mapped reads that correspond to protein coding, mitochondrial, ribosomal genes etc. Similarly, what proportion of the top X,Y,Z genes are each of these categories [compare to other libraries]
- Add new library stats/figures to summarize what % of all maped reads correspond to the top 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, etc. genes [compare to other libraries]
- Implement extra normalization option.  Stand alone step that grabs all feature exp values files, joins into a matrix, normalizes, parses results and overwrites values in exp files


#Medium Website Improvements
- DE page - make table less verbose
- Expression page - make table less verbose
- Fix line plot legend size for small library numbers
- Add option to allow highlighting of AS features from group comparison results instead of pairwise
- Incorporate gene *names* into line plots


#MISC
1. Make Expression summary files for Intergenics consistent with other feature types
The following file has Upstream_Gene_ID and Downstream_Gene_ID. Could these be presented as ENSG IDs?
read_records/600MPE/Intergenics_v53/Summary/*_IntergenicExpression_v53.txt

The following files do not have any kind of Upstream_Gene_ID and Downstream_Gene_ID. Add?
read_records/600MPE/Intergenics_v53/Summary/*_SilentIntergenicRegionExpression_v53.txt
read_records/600MPE/Intergenics_v53/Summary/*_ActiveIntergenicRegionExpression_v53.txt

2. Assuming (1) done. Add concatenated value of Upstream_Gene_ID+Downstream_Gene_ID to matrix files.
